# Student Dev Training
Welcome to the new job, recruits. Below is the list of training required to help you become an integral part of the OIT Application Development team.

This training involves a bit of reading and a lot of coding, but once you get to the end of it all, you will be well on your way to becoming the "Full Stack Web Developer" that you applied for. All of this training will help you discuss/work on/fix/maintain applications with full-time staff, fulfill tickets, and vastly improve your overall knowledge of software development concepts and implementation (aka, CPS classes get a bit easier). 

## Objectives
In this training, you will learn different types of languages. First, you will learn how to use and navigate through the wiki. Navigation of the wiki is essential if you want to find necessary files, snippets of code, and work efficiently. 

Once you understand how to use the wiki, you will begin front end development. Front end development is how the website looks and interreacts with the users. The material understood will be HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other more advanced topics. (More Specific information will be given in each individual topic)

After mastering front end development, you will move into backend development. Necessary materials required to know include C# and Angular. They are the program that performs the task, such as sorting a list.

Finally, you should be able to program Front end and Back End together to create a useful functional website.

## Setup
See [New Developer Setup - Setup Computer](https://code.cmich.edu/IT-AppDevelopment/Documentation/wiki/-/wikis/policy-new-developer-setup#setup-computer) for things like Visual Studio and VSCode

## Advice from previous <s>Sages</s> Students
* <b>Don't flail</b> - If you spend like an hour making changes to code you don't understand or are not even sure where to begin, go ask someone else for help.
* <b>Read all instructions</b> - In this line of work, it's extremely important that you follow every step that is laid out, because whoever wrote those instructions put it there for a reason. A missed step can cause catastrophic problems down the road (think, CMU website being inaccessible, students can't sign up for classes during sign-up period, Blackboard is shut down, type of events/errors/mistakes).
* <b>Feel the burn</b> - It's extremely likely that you will make a mistake at some point. Every coder has made a mistake, and if you haven't, code more. What's most important is that you learn from it and don't make it again. Breaking the testing server once is a mistake and you need to be more cautious the next time. Doing it twice means you failed to learn and moreover shows your boss(es)/coworkers that you don't care about learning from them.
* <b>When in doubt, Ctrl + F5</b> - The work of web development can be particularly frustrating. One of the more frustrating moments that you can encounter is you make changes to static content or some CSS and no matter how many times you save and refresh the page, the change isn't showing up. As long as you're looking in the right place, try holding the <b>Ctrl</b> key and pressing <b>F5</b>. This will make the browser do what's called a hard refresh, which makes the browser clear its cache and pull the pages fresh.
* <b>The Wiki and The Grand Collection of Knowledge</b> - Sages of the past have devoted much of their knowledge, expertise, and fancy work-arounds to further enhance the work of everyone else. On top of that, if you find a solution that you can't find in The Wiki, add it. This will further you along the path to becoming a Sage (and a long road it is) as well as help everyone else. Be sure to record solutions you find and make them easy to find. <b>ADD TAGS</b> to pages (see [[Tags]](https://code.cmich.edu/IT-AppDevelopment/Documentation/wiki/wikis/How-to-tag-wiki-page))) for proper use and existing tags.
