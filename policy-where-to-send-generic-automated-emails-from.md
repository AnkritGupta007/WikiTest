# Summary
Generic automated emails should no longer be sent from [webtodo@cmich.edu](mailto:webtodo@cmich.edu) but should instead be sent from [autoweb@cmich.edu](autoweb@cmich.edu).

- As a general policy, use [autoweb@cmich.edu](autoweb@cmich.edu) in the **From:** field when your web application is emailing users and there is no specific email account that already exists that logically is linked to our app, or where reply emails would typically be returned to, an exception example might be *registra@cmich.edu* ). 
- This also applies to emails sent to [TG-AppDevEmailMonitor@CentralMichigan.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:TG-AppDevEmailMonitor@CentralMichigan.onmicrosoft.com) for automatic *TeamDynamix* ticket generation.
