# Summary (Work in Progress)
**Standard and Routine Changes** are deployments that are auto-approved, and this page aims to explain when they are the optimal type of change calendar item. These sorts of changes are low risk changes to configurations and static files (e.g., modify a `web.config` on a Prod Web Server or a `.js` the Prod CDN Server). These Standard and Routine change calendar items are intended to give an audit trail as to why changes were made on *production* servers, while allowing developers the freedom to make timely changes that benefit students, faculty and staff.
