  - Methods and Methodologies - streamlined practices
  - Mindset
    - Discuss value of daily standup, for example
    - `Fractured perspectives` - not everyone on the same page

## Agile Values

  - Present Waterfall model
    - Discuss issues with Waterfall
      - Difficulty to adjust to change
  - No `best` way to work with Agile
    - Not one size, fits all
    - More like guidelines than rules
  - 4 Values
    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan
  - Agile Methodologies – collection of practices combined with ideas, advice, and often a body of knowledge and wealth of experience among agile practitioners
    - Outlines roles and responsibilities
    - Recommends certain practices during certain phases of the project

## Agile Principles
  - Principles over practices – `A recipe can teach one great dish. A technique can teach you several` - Michael Symon
  - 12 Principles
    - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
 through early and continuous delivery
 of valuable software.
    - Welcome changing requirements, even late in
 development. Agile processes harness change for
 the customer`s competitive advantage.
    - Deliver working software frequently, from a
 couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
 preference to the shorter timescale.
    - Business people and developers must work
 together daily throughout the project.
    - Build projects around motivated individuals.
 Give them the environment and support they need,
 and trust them to get the job done.
    - The most efficient and effective method of
 conveying information to and within a development
 team is face-to-face conversation.
    - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    - Agile processes promote sustainable development.
 The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
 to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
    - Continuous attention to technical excellence
 and good design enhances agility.
    - Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
 of work not done--is essential.
    - The best architectures, requirements, and designs
 emerge from self-organizing teams.
    - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
 to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
 its behavior accordingly.
  - The principles depend on the idea that we build projects to deliver value
    - Problem: everyone sees different value in the software
      - Different people need different things from it – stakeholders

## Scrum
- Five values
  - Each person is **committed** to the project's goals
  - Team members **respect** each other
  - Everyone is **focused** on the work
  - The teams value **openness**
  - Team members have the **courage** to standup for the project
- Three roles
    - Product Owner
      - Helps the team understand the value of the software
      - Works with the team to maintain and prioritize a product backlog of features and requirements that need to be built
      - Establishes the team's commitment to the stakeholders
        - Finds ways to keep the team's understanding of goals current
        - Keeps up the team's feeling of commitment
      - Makes decisions on behalf of the stakeholders
        - Answers the detailed questions from the team on what they'll be building and how users will use the features they're working on
        - Makes many small decisions on how the product will work
      - Keeps in communication with stakeholders to stay on top of changes to stakeholder needs
    - Scrum Master
      - Guides the Team's decisions
      - Works with team to bypass roadblocks identified by the team and requested help to clear
      - Does not own the project plan
        - Can help create the plan
        - Guides the team's use of Scrum and its practices
        - Helps everyone feel like they own the plan together
    - Team Member
      - Develops the software
- Everyone on the team has ownership of the project
- Creating the backlog
 - Performed by the Product Owner with team's input
    - User Story
      - As a {_type of user_}, I want to {_specific action I'm taking_} so that {_what I want to happen as a result_}.
      - Simple description of a specific way a user will use the software
    - Conditions of satisfaction
      - What a user story looks like when completed
      - Helps the team know what the software will look like when it's complete
      - Gauges how close they are to done
      - AKA acceptance criteria
      - Establishes the Definition of Done
    - Story points
      - Way to understand how much effort needed to build a specific user story
      - Points established by comparing current user story to other stories built in the past
    - Helps with estimation
- Sprints
  - Timeboxed iterations
  - Sprint planning at start of each sprint
- Sprint Planning
  - Determine which features from the backlog built during that sprint
  - Artifact of sprint planning – sprint backlog
  - Some tips
    - Prioritize the users' immediate needs first
    - Be realistic about what you can deliver
    - Change the plan if it needs to change
    - Get everyone talking about value
- Daily Standup
    - What did you work on yesterday?
    - What are you working on today?
    - Are there any impediments
    - Some tips
      - Hold yourself accountable to your teammates
        - If a commitment wasn't met, explain what happened
      - Take detailed conversations offline
      - Take turns going first each day
      - Don't treat it like a ritual
        - Primary source of team cadences each day
      - Everyone participates
      - Inspect every task
        - Bring up potential problems now rather than further down the road
      - Change the plan if it needs to change
- Sprint Review
  - End of sprint, show off finished user stories from sprint
  - Obtain feedback from stakeholders
  - Confirm Definition of Done
- Retrospective
  - Done after sprint review by team
  - Identify areas of team improvement beyond surface level
    - Three simple questions
      - What worked well
      - What didn't work well
      - What are we going to try and do differently?
- Five phases
  - Set the stage
    - Set the goal; Give people time to `arrive` and get into the right mood
  - Gather data
    - Help everyone remember; Create a shared pool of information (everybody sees the world differently)
  - Generate insight
    - Why did things happen the way they did?; Identify patterns; See the big picture
  - Decide what to do
    - Pick a few issues to work on and create concrete action plans of how you'll address them
  - Close the retrospective
    - Clarify follow-up; Appreciations; Clear end; How could the retrospectives improve?

## Kanban
- Method for process improvement
- Start by understanding the way software is currently built then make improvements over time
- Helps reduce waste, inefficiency, and inconsistency
- Core practices:
  - First, follow the foundational principles
    - Start with what you know
    - Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
    - Initially respect current roles, responsibilities, and job titles
  - Then adopt core practices
    - Visualize
    - Limit WIP
    - Manage Flow
    - Make Process Policies Explicit
    - Implement Feedback Loops
    - Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally
- Kanban board
    - Tool that teams use to visualize their workflow
      - Only show stories, do not show tasks
    - Daily meeting `walking the board`
      - Discuss state of each item on board
    - Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)
      - Setting a limit on the number of work items that can be in a particular stage in the project's workflow
    - Manage flow
      - Little's Law
        - Average inventory is always equal to the average arrival date multiplied by the average lead time
          - L = W x λ
        - Lead time is determined entirely by the rate that work items arrive into your system
      - Adjust flow using WIP limits
        - Naturally creates slack (wiggle room) in the schedule
      - Instead of timeboxing, adopt a delivery cadence
        - Commit to delivering software on a regular schedule
    - Making process policies explicit
      - Adding Definitions of Done or exit criteria to bottom of each column of the kanban board
