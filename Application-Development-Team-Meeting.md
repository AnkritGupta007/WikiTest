# Application Development Team Meeting and Standup Meeting

We plan to hold meetings every other week. The general format will be [Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) and we have been using a Trello Board ([dev-lean-coffee-cmu](https://trello.com/b/UX8Xw3m3/dev-lean-coffee-cmu)) to facilitate the meetings virtually.

## Basic principles:
- Spend 2 minutes adding cards
  - Card topics should be added throughout the two weeks in between meetings as team member think of ideas
  - Card topics can be broad in scope and about non-IT topics but may not receive votes
- Spend 3 minutes voting on cards of interest
- Someone will be the **facilitator** and someone will be the **clerk** to record *Outcomes* (i.e.,  Action Items and Decisions)
- The card with the most votes gets a *30 second intro* and is discussed for 5 minutes^
- After 5 minutes the team votes if they want to discuss more about the current card: `yes`, `not sure`, `no`
  - For demos of technology or projects, we have decided we do not need to re-vote every 5 minutes
- If discussion dies before the 5 minutes we can put it to a vote early
- After the discussion has ended on a card a new card with the most votes is selected
- Repeat the process until the meeting ends
- Votes on cards are cleared and discussed cards are archived by the **facilitator**
- Any card over 2 months old is also archived by the **facilitator**
- *Outcomes* (i.e.,  Action Items and Decisions) will be emailed out to `ApplicationDevelopmentTeam@groups.cmich.edu` by the **clerk**
  - Decisions should usually have a link to a new Wiki Policy page


^ - For updates from our manager, in-depth demos and a few other formats, discussion can automatically run for 20+ minutes without renewal

## Stand-up Meetings
Our team currently holds daily standup meetings as a team with the following intended outcomes
- Gives leadership a sense of what is happening operationally 
- Allows team members a forum to ask for help 
- Allows team members to offer help 
- Provides transparency as to what leadership is doing 
- Remove blockers 
- Communicate expectations
