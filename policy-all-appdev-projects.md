# Summary
The purpose of this policy is to standardize how we as a team use Gitlab for our projects.

## Requirements

* All projects will have readme pages with required elements - [Link](how-to-setup-a-project-readme)
* All projects will use Gitlab (code.cmich.edu) for their source code repository
* New codebases will use a production ready application template found here [App-Templates](https://code.cmich.edu/IT-AppDevelopment/Templates) unless an exception is provided by the Associate Director of Application Development 
* Maintain change logs - [Link](how-to-keep-a-change-log)
* When possible, projects will use deployment scripts and be deployed through Gitlab
* New codebases development after 1/1/2017 should use appropriate Unit and Integration testing
* All deployments will show some evidence of testing prior to going to production. The level of testing required depends on the type of change being deployed.
    * Evidence includes:
        * Automated Testing (i.e. unit, integration and end to end testing)
        * Documented (preferably in the TDX Ticket) enduser sign off
        * Documented self testing
        * Documented peer testing
        * Peer code review
