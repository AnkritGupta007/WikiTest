# Summary (WIP)

When working on added a fix or new feature to a Legacy Application that is not currently deployed through Gitlab follow these **Recommendations**.

## Recommendations
- Have a conversation with the business user(s) to let them know that this is a legacy application
- Seek to brainstorm with them about alternative ways to seek the business value they desire
- As needed, talk with a Team Lead or Architect when you question the value of modifying a legacy app, to get OIT support
- As a general rule, if you cannot get the existing application to a compile and into a functional state in 2 business days, return to update the business user(s) and have further discussion about alternatives
- If you sense this work will take far more than the 20 hours allotted to ticket work, recommend connecting with the PMO to get a project charter started
