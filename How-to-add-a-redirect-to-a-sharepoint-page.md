# How to add a redirect to a SharePoint page
If Ever you need to redirect users to an alternative page (inside or outside SharePoint) when they visit a certain page in SharePoint, these are the steps to do that. Note that *to check the functionality after you are done*, you need to visit the page in Incognito Mode in your browser or *have another non-admin user confirm that it works*.

## Steps
1. You will *need admin privileges* on the SharePoint page to perform this task. This can be confirmed by looking for the "Admin Gear"
1. From the **Admin Gear** select **Edit Page**
