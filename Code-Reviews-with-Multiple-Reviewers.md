Communicate the intent:
- If you want multiple reviewers to approve, say so. Indicate in the merge request both in words and using the tools in GitLab. 
- If you are OK with anyone, then just assign to multiple people and no extra communication needed.
- Use only communication if you don't care to assign someone (i.e. through chat). Please indicate if you are going to pick it up for review.
