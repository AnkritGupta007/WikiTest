- Each student will be paired with a member of the staff who has expressed interest in mentoring
- The Mentor is the Students FIRST point of contact. If the mentor is unavailable for an extended period of time the student is encouraged to ask questions in the Student Channel on Teams. If all else fails the Student can reach out to the Coordinator or Team Lead.
- The terms of the relationship should be defined between the Mentor and the Student. Each pairing should try to set goals/responsibilities/expectations within the first couple of days to create a common set of guiding principles. 
- Pairings will last for 2 months then students will rotate to another Mentor. Remember to re-establish the terms of the relationship.
- Should any conflict arise it is encouraged to work out the problem between yourselves, however in the event mediation is required please contact the Coordinator or a Team Lead.
- Mentors are expected to assist the Student on all code reviews and production changes
- Also see [Student Expectations](Student-Expectations)
