All students are expected to provide a schedule of their hours at the start of, or before, every semester. These should be entered on the students Outlook Calendar, status set to `Free`, as reoccurring events with a title like `Work Schedule` or `Work Schedule - Remote` (when working remote that shift). For your own privacy we recommend you don't enter a "Location" for your "Work Schedule" events. These hours can be changed, but remember students are limited to working 40 hours per pay period with the exception of the summer term where students may work full time (see dates **[here](https://www.cmich.edu/fas/hr/ses/Pages/Hire%20Dates.aspx)**). Students are encouraged to prioritize their education and can take any time-off as needed to complete their course work by communicating with the Team Leads. Students should expose their calendar like full-time staff, instructions can be found **[here](Calendar-permissions-policy)**.

## During work hours
Students are expected to hold the same standards as full-time staff. This list is not comprehensive:
- Show up on time
- [Clock in and out](https://tcp.apps.cmich.edu/) (if you make a mistake add a note to the time entry listing the correct In and Out times)
- Avoid excessive distractions (Don't play games, watch tv, etc. unless permitted as a group activity)
- Follow all university policies and rules (see [Resources](#resources) below)

## Who do I report to?
Students should always reach out to their mentor first however there may be a time where your mentor is unavailable. If this is the case you may contact the next name in this list:
1. Mentor
1. Mentoring Coordinator (Eric J). If unavailable another Team Lead (Nathan)
1. Director (Eric W) 

## What do I work on?
New student hires should review all resources below and for the first few months focus on completing the **[Training Docs](student-developer-training)**. After training is completed, you and your mentor will establish how you will be assigned work. Should any free time become available you may:
1. Ask for something to do from the first available supervisor
1. Grab a ticket from the Operations Queue
1. Read up on and/or play with a technology you are unfamiliar with

## Prod changes
- For code changes, communicate with a full-time staff member (i.e., your mentor) to do the deployment on your behalf. 
- For production database data changes, communicate with a full-time staff member, and they can screen share with you as you make the change, to assist when things go unexpectedly
- For non-production changes (e.g., testing, staging) students can made database changes and do code deployments. Gitlab may limit your ability to merge `master` into `testing` branches to trigger a deployment and requires a full-time staff member's help. (This is because of Gitlab limitations. Gitlab doesn't allow different permissions based on branch, it's either "they can merge everything, even into `production`" or "they can't do any merges on their own", so for now, we have chosen the later.
