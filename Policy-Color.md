# Color
Color styles define how color is used in the application template

[Color in Material Design](https://material.io/design/color/#) is inspired by bold hues juxtaposed with muted environments, deep shadows, and bright highlights.

## ACCESSIBILITY
As per [WCAG 2.0 1.4.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html), do not use color as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting response, or distinguishing a visual element (Level A).

If using a background and foreground color, ensure there is enough color contrast to meet WCAG AA requirements using WebAim's color contrast tool.

## Color Palette
The color palette for the application template utilizes a small sample of the material design color palette. Starting with the primary (#6A0032) and secondary (#FFC82E) colors, the material design palette fills in the spectrum to create a complete and usable palette. To consist with Cmich branding, all material design colors are only to be used as complementary design elements to convey information. Primary and secondary design elements should utilize maroon (#6A0032) and gold (#FFC82E).

The primary hue of the colors are the 500 hues, with the 300 and 700 hues being the lighter and darker variations respectively. If using one of these colors as a design element, the 500 hue should be used. The 300 and 700 should only be used as compliments to the primary.

Some color groups have very specific purposes and usage of these colors should not go outside the intended usage. Please refer to the "Color Usage Overview" section below. Any exceptions should be brought to the attention of the design team.
