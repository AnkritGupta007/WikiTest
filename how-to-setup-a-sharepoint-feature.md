## Setting up a Feature  

*   If you haven't already added a feature, right click on "Features" in the solution explorer and select "Add Feature"
*   Rename the feature file (will be Feature1 for a new feature) to the same as the project name. This is documented in the [SharePoint Naming Conventions.](Naming-Conventions#SharePoint)

*   Double click on the newly renamed feature to get to the feature settings fill out the following properties

*   Title: Should be the Feature's Name
*   Description: Compiled <TODAY'S_DATE> - Version <ASSEMBLY_VERSION> - Brief description of what the project is used for

*   If this is a new project the assembly version will be 1.0.0.0  

*   Scope: This could change depending on what type of project you are building, but for the most part it should be set to "Site"
