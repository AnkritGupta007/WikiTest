# Front-End Environment
In this assignment, you will be learning about LESS (or SASS), the dynamic CSS pre-processor language that we use internally in OIT. LESS allows you to use things like variables (so you don't have to change commonly used styles throughout your stylesheet), mixins (a groups of styles that you can apply to any elements) and nested rules (a structured way for writing your code).

Additionally, we'll set up your desktop environment to allow you use Visual Studio to develop web content. We'll get you going with our Application Template (a html / css / javscript template we use to develop web applications) and get familiar with front-end web development.

# Outcome(s)
* Gain an understanding about front-end development and our application template.
* Gain knowledge about LESS CSS.
* Gain an understanding about Javascript and Typescript.

# Assignment
* Review features of LESS: http://lesscss.org/features/
* Review features of SASS: https://sass-lang.com/guide
* Review the TypeScript documentation https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html. Feel free to go over the "Typescript in 5 minutes tutorial" on the site.
* See me so we can set up your environment and get you coding in LESS time (see what I did there?).
