ESS Redirect uses SharePoint lists to handle redirects.

The lists are found at the root of the main cmich web site and CentralLink.

* Main page > Site Contents > Redirect List - Main (https://www.cmich.edu/Lists/Redirect%20List%20%20Main/AllItems.aspx)
* CentralLink > Site Contents > Redirect List - Main (https://www.cmich.edu/centrallink/Lists/Redirect%20List%20%20Main/AllItems.aspx)

From here, redirects can be updated as needed.

Just saving this for now so the documentation isn't lost when my browser inevitably reloads this page.
