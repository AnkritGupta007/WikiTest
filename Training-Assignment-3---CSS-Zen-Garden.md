# CSS Zen Garden
In this assignment, you will take existing HTML markup and use your CSS skills to come up with a custom web design.

## Outcome(s)
* Gain knowledge about CSS
* Learn to style existing HTML markup that you don't have control over and cannot modify
* Applying your creativity and design skills

## Resource(s)
- CSS Zen Garden: http://www.csszengarden.com/
   - Read the material on this site to better understand the CSS Zen Garden project. If you need help setting up the project or need additional information, let me know and I'll help.
- Good style Guide and best practices for HTML and CSS: https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html
   - The above code has one *bad* piece of advice, that you should [omit optional tags](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Optional_Tags). You should **always** close your tags (e.g., `<li>First List Item</li>`), it makes chasing down HTML bugs easier for you and those who come after you.

## Assignment
Using the text editor of your choice, create a valid CSS file for the CSS Zen Garden Page. The requirements are:

* Download the CSS Zen Garden HTML here: http://www.csszengarden.com/zengarden-sample.html
* Do NOT alter any HTML markup, except the link to the CSS file, change it to point to the local CSS file you are creating for this assignment.
* Be as creative as possible. This is your first chance to show off your awesome design skills.

Validate the CSS- http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. No errors should be present (warnings will be OK)

**Zip your HTML and CSS files (along with any images if you are using those) and submit your assignment to your Team Lead.**

* Note: This project will be reviewed by the Design Team in a code review. A meeting will be scheduled where there may be takeaways (such as recommendations and fixes) that will require you to resubmit the project again. This will get you familiar with our design review and critiquing processes.
